# Inventory Tracker

Welcome to the inventory_tracker web app.
It's a simple app that keeps track of a fictitious restaurant's inventory, through 4 Models (Ingredients, MenuItems, ItemRequirements and Purchases). 
- You can view the Database details in the models.py file (including table relations).

This is a Micro-Project of mine using the Django Framework, to practice the following:

- The URL/View/Model/Template logic flow.
- Perform CRUD Operations on Database data Through the Web Interface (not admin panel).
	- List/Delete/Update/Add Instances from different Models.
- Using Class-Based Views and Forms.
- Implementing Forms and redirects.
- Implementing a Centralised Authentication System using Login, Signup and Logout Pages.
- Requiring Login to view templates by using decorators and mixins.
